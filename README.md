nlpTools - Natural Language Processing Toolkit for PHP
======================================================

Text processing framework to analyse Natural Language by performing
operations and tasks on corpus data. Hence, this approach focuses on 
the statistical/quantitative track of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Related fields
--------------

* Computational Linguistics (CL)
* Corpus Linguistics
* Information Retrieval
* Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Pattern 
Recognition

The differences among the aforementioned fields related to NLP are a
matter of perspective and taste. Nonetheless, NLP is more frequently
regarded to be an engineering-oriented approach while CL is rather more
associated with theoretical aspects.
