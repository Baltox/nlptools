nlpTools - Natural Language Processing Toolkit for PHP
======================================================

The toolkit is deployed by directly copying the "core" folder wherever 
it is desired and by making it accessible to the applications. Module 
dependencies are set relative to their file paths.

PEAR DB needs to be available.

The documentation has to be produced with Doxygen:

> `doxygen doc/nlptools.dox.cfg`

and it may be consulted in the "doc/html" folder.
