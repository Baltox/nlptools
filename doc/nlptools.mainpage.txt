/**
 * @mainpage nlpTools - Natural Language Processing Toolkit for PHP
 * 
 * @par General concept
 * Text processing framework to analyse Natural Language by performing
 * operations and tasks on corpus data. Hence, this approach focuses on 
 * the statistical track of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
 *
 * @par Code
 * Written in the PHP programming language for its suitability to 
 * process text on the web (i.e., by definition, the Hypertext 
 * Preprocessor).
 *
 * Loosely coupled modular design, with orthogonality, reusability and 
 * extensibility in mind, to not compromise its future growth.
 *
 * Specific preconditions on parameter types are enforced with Type 
 * Hinting on objects and arrays, and casts to string, int, bool or 
 * float, on primitive types. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to 
 * consider the parameter descriptions in the documentation and to follow 
 * the contracts defined in the interface prototypes. 
 *
 * Other preconditions unrelated to type checking are asserted.
 *
 * The rationale for using exceptions is to throw them only for 
 * Exceptional Problems. The strict following of the contracts should 
 * suffice to operate successfully.
